# DistributionFittingShiny
Distribution fitting for hydrology, also can be run via  https://rm8lgi-berkay-akp0nar.shinyapps.io/FittingApp/

Data should have the following columns (as .txt,.csv.xlsx)

-Year, -Month, -Day, -Precipitation, -Snow_Depth, -Average_Temperature, -Maximum_Temperature

Please be sure that your file has the mentioned headers
What can be observed in Main Panels (Right Side):

Daily Max Values: This dataset created to obtain annual based daily maximum precipitation, occurence date and the snow depth at that time and maximum snow depth, occurence date and the precipitation at that time

Fitted Values: This dataset gives fitted values for different distributions and return periods

ECDF and Theoritical Plots: The plots show ECDF depictions of fitted distributions

P values: The P-Values of Anderson-Darling and Cramer_von_Misses goodness of fit tests for distributions
